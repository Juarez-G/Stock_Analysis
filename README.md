# Stock_Analysis

### Overview of Project
   Steve loves the workbook that was prepared for him. At the click of a button, he can analyze an entire dataset and clear it to restart. Now, to do a little more          research for his parents, he wants to expand the dataset to include the entire stock market over the last few years. Although the code works well for a dozen stocks,    it might not work as well for thousands of stocks. And if it does, it may take a long time to execute.  There needs to be a refactor of the original code to enhance      the speed at which the data is run for more efficiency.

### Results

  The analysis is well described with screenshots and code (4 pt).
